**Overview**

This project focuses on the recognition of hand gestures in real-time using a live webcam feed. It's an exciting application of computer vision and machine learning techniques, specifically designed to understand and interpret human hand gestures.

**Key Features**
- Real-Time Hand Gesture Recognition: Utilized a live webcam feed to recognize and interpret hand gestures as they occur in real time.
- MediaPipe Integration: Leveraged the capabilities of MediaPipe for efficient hand tracking and gesture recognition.
- Custom Hand Gesture Dataset: Used a specially curated dataset of hand gestures to train the model, ensuring a wide range of gesture recognition.
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Used CNN for training the model, enabling it to accurately identify various hand gestures.
- TensorFlow Framework: Built using TensorFlow

**How It Works**

The project uses MediaPipe for hand tracking, which provides real-time hand detection and landmark identification. A custom dataset of hand gestures is used to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. This model, built and trained using TensorFlow, is capable of recognizing different hand gestures captured through a webcam.
